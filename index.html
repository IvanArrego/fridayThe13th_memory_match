                            <h3>Story</h3>
                            <p> This was just a way for you to make some extra cash over the summer. You knew this would be an easy gig, all you would have to do is babysit some kids. <br>
                                Everything was smooth sailing until he showed up. 
                            </p>
                            <h3>Objective</h3>
                            <p>
                            <p><strong>Save them</strong><br>
                                To win you must save all the counselors. You must match 2 of the same counselors to save them but watch out!
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Lose</strong><br>
                                If you match 2 of the same Jason card then you has found you. 
                            </p>
